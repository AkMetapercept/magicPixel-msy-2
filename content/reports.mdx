# Reports

The Reports module displays the details similar to Dashboard. However, there is no visualization of data unlike Dashboards. You can display reports either for the Staging or Production environment.

Although in Live Debugging and Dashboards the tag details are available, the Reports data is mainly used to debug what all tags are triggered and how many times a particular tag is triggered and additional metrics used for data analysis purposes. Furthermore, Reports are the main source of data to troubleshoot errors or missing information at the tag level, provider level, transformation function, configuration issue, or missing attributes, due to which failures happen.
