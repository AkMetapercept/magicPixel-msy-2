# Qualification Criteria

The Qualification Criteria are similar to Triggers that are performed to trigger the tag for a specific condition. The MagicPixel triggers the tag when the Qualification Criteria is met for either browser-side tags or server-side tags.

**Note**: The Qualification Criteria evaluates the conditions when the tag must be triggered. For a particular tag to trigger the qualification criteria is optional. However, when the Qualification Criteria is provided along with the Triggers, then the conditions for Triggers and Qualification Criteria must return true. Only then the tag gets triggered. 

Also, if the Qualification Criteria is not defined, then the tag is triggered when only the triggers are invoked. Any number of Data Elements may be added for the Qualification Criteria using the **Actions -> Edit** on the top right corner of the screen. Click **Add Data Element** to add a new Data Element.
